Mood2Music üéµ
Mood2Music is a web app designed to find music based on your current mood. Simply click on the button that represents your mood, and the app will fetch recommendations using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API. Each recommendation includes an embedded video, a title, and a description. Note: Sometimes the embedded video may not work due to the AI's limited browsing capabilities.
